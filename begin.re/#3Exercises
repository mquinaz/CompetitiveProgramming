# For password exercise:
cheking strings view, we can see the string "correct" or "incorrect", following that:

sub_401090 proc near

Str1= byte ptr -104h
var_4= dword ptr -4

push    ebp
mov     ebp, esp
sub     esp, 104h
mov     eax, ___security_cookie
xor     eax, ebp
mov     [ebp+var_4], eax
push    100h            ; Size
lea     eax, [ebp+Str1]
push    0               ; Val
push    eax             ; ArgList
call    memset
push    offset Format   ; "Enter password: "
call    sub_401020
lea     eax, [ebp+Str1]
push    eax             ; Arglist
push    offset aS       ; "%s"
call    sub_401050
push    7               ; MaxCount
lea     eax, [ebp+Str1]
push    offset Str2     ; "cr4ckm3"
push    eax             ; Str1
call    ds:strncmp
add     esp, 24h
test    eax, eax
jnz     short loc_401109

where two blocks had either "correct" or "incorrect". Even without the comments we can see that strcmp is comparing input with str2(password) and then test eax,eax to see if 0.
